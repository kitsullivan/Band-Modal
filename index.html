          <p class="modal-copy">Hannah Hampton is a Columbus local who spends her weekdays singing to her kindergarteners she teaches and her weekends singing to her friends (new and old) at restaurants and bars around town. Her original pop songs are all written about experiences she’s had in life. She also likes to cover music that people know and will sing along to with her. Whether that be Umbrella by Rihanna or Hotel California — she covers it all. Her favorite part about performing is the connections she gets to make with the strangers that are listening. Whether it be an actual conversation with someone or eye contact they make while they’re both singing along to the same song— Hannah truly believes music brings people together in a shared moment where everything else in life (our troubles, differences, etc.) can be pushed aside for a brief moment in time.</p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hannah_sings17/"  target="_blank">Follow on Instagram</a>

          <p class="modal-copy">Waves de Aché is a Columbus-based band blending modern jazz harmony with rhythms rooted in Afro-Cuban Salsa music. Aché is a term from Santeria religion (founded in Cuba) that refers to a positive life force energy that is experienced more easily than explained. This idea is mirrored in the music inspired by this tradition; the listener wants to listen and take in the richness of the harmony and melody, but the power of the rhythms make it hard to sit still. Waves de Aché is led by percussionist Max Marsillo and bassist Will Strickler, both graduates of the Capital University Conservatory of Music. The band plays original compositions and songs by Latin jazz masters such as Paquito D’Rivera, Hilton Ruiz, Ed Simon and more. Completing the group’s line-up are some of Ohio’s finest musicians, Nate Parker on drums, Kevin O’Neill on saxophone &amp; flute, Anthony Stanco on trumpet &amp; flugelhorn and Ben Maloney on piano.</p>
